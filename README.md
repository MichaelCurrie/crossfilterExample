This visualization is a slightly expanded version of the excellent original Crossfilter demo [here](http://square.github.io/crossfilter/)
  
The visualization adds four items to the original example:

1. Ability to filter on days (Monday) and day types (Weekend), in addition to existing dimensions/filters
2. A dataset "view", that allows all of the 230K records to be viewed in a canvas element below the visualization. 
3. A timer function/object that can be used to determine the performance of various aspects of the the crossfilter operation
4. Expanded and more detailed comments, perhaps helpful when trying to understand the original example

Note: added comments and code is marked "BoE"
